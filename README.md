# DragonChain
- It is an hybrid block chain (public + private) which uses proof of time as a consensus algorithms.

# Why world needs DragonChain
- We created many solftwares and technologies thta we can do anything from our mobile by any website or application.
- but there is one problem is it is centralised as there is middleman which helps use for every tasks. i.e bank for money transaction
- so we needed way to make things decetralised and digitalised our money and privacy.
- we tried creating e-currency but it has one biggest problem of double spending
- but st the end satoshi nakamoto solved it ny creating Bitcoins and after that we started improving it.
- after we need private block chain so we created hyper ledger 
- but we also need something to be public
- so the solution is DragonChain

# Pricing Model:
- Level 1 Node (Not a validation node, this is the Distributed Ledger) 2500 + .01/transaction
- Level 2 Enterprise (Validation) nodes have an initial spin up cost of $250 + fees
- Level 3 Network Diversity nodes have an initial spin up cost of $2,500 + fees
- Level 4 External Partner (Notary) nodes have an initial spin up cost of $25,000 + fees
- Level 5 Proof of Existence (Price not yet released)
 
# Dragon/DRGN:
- A Dragon is a tokenized micro-license used to interact with the Dragonchain commercial platform services.
- Total supply of DRGN is capped at 433,494,437 Dragons.

# What is TIME
- TIME is the mechanism through which Dragon holders gain rewards for holding Dragon tokens over time. 
- This creates a loyalty program for holders, helping to reduce volatility and keep funds secure. 
- Dragons do not accumulate TIME when held in an exchange wallet.


# How TIME is Calculated:
- Note
  - TIME is calculated with a Last-in-First-Out (LIFO) accounting method. This means that the TIME attached to the most recently-added Dragons will be the first to go if any move out of a wallet
- If I have 100 Dragons and I hold it for 10 days then my TIME will be 1000.
- If I have 100 Dragons on day 10 and I add more 20 dragons on day 11 then my TIME on day 11 will be 1120, how? :(100 *11) + (20 * 1) = 1120
- 100 Dragons are put in an empty wallet. Five days later 50 more are added. On day 5 the TIME is 100*5 = 500. On day 6 the TIME is 500+100+50. On day 10 the TIME is (100 * 10)+(50 * 5)=1250. On day 10, 25 Dragons are sent from this wallet elsewhere. The TIME is now (100 * 10)+(25 * 5)=1125. (Notice the TIME is subtracted from the 25 Dragons most recently added, not the older ones.)

# Dragon Net
- It is a distributed blockchain for concensus in dragonchain.
- Concecsus is done by 5 level of varification nodes

# 5 Levels of varification
- L1: where we deploy smart contract and store sensitive data.
- L2: Validate block, headers and transactions
- L3: Network diversity of L2 validations
- L4: signs the validations done by L3 node (notry process)
- L5: Connect with publich blockchains

# Interchain
- It allow us to connect our private dragonchin blockchain with available public blockchains(ETH, BTC)

# Dragon Factor
- It is an identity service, provide users access to there data and enable feature to set data privacy so them can limit access.

# Dragon Academy
- collection of resources  for learning

# Dragon Scale
- Dragonscale is a network connecting blockchain and crypto-related startups to the resources needed for successful launches.

# Dragon Den
- Dragon Den is a decentralized community built on the Dragonchain platform. Dragon Den is Dragonchainâ€™s answer to fake news, trolling, bot posts, and censorship. Den incentivizes the creation and evaluation of quality content within a community.
