- It is an hybrid block chain (public + private) which uses proof of time as a consensus algorithms.

# Why world needs DragonChain
- We created many solftwares and technologies thta we can do anything from our mobile by any website or application.
- but there is one problem is it is centralised as there is middleman which helps use for every tasks. i.e bank for money transaction
- so we needed way to make things decetralised and digitalised our money and privacy.
- we tried creating e-currency but it has one biggest problem of double spending
- but st the end satoshi nakamoto solved it ny creating Bitcoins and after that we started improving it.
- after we need private block chain so we created hyper ledger 
- but we also need something to be public
- so the solution is DragonChain
