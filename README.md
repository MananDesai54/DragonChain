# DragonChain
- It is an hybrid block chain (public + private) which uses proof of time as a consensus algorithms.

# Why world needs DragonChain
- We created many solftwares and technologies thta we can do anything from our mobile by any website or application.
- but there is one problem is it is centralised as there is middleman which helps use for every tasks. i.e bank for money transaction
- so we needed way to make things decetralised and digitalised our money and privacy.
- we tried creating e-currency but it has one biggest problem of double spending
- but st the end satoshi nakamoto solved it ny creating Bitcoins and after that we started improving it.
- after we need private block chain so we created hyper ledger 
- but we also need something to be public
- so the solution is DragonChain

# Dragon/DRGN:
- A Dragon is a tokenized micro-license used to interact with the Dragonchain commercial platform services.
- Total supply of DRGN is capped at 433,494,437 Dragons.

# How TIME is Calculated:
- If I have 100 Dragons and I hold it for 10 days then my TIME will be 1000.
- If I have 100 Dragons on day 10 and I add more 20 dragons on day 11 then my TIME on day 11 will be 1120, how? :(100 *11) + (20 * 1) = 1120
- 100 Dragons are put in an empty wallet. Five days later 50 more are added. On day 5 the TIME is 100*5 = 500. On day 6 the TIME is 500+100+50. On day 10 the TIME is (100 * 10)+(50 * 5)=1250. On day 10, 25 Dragons are sent from this wallet elsewhere. The TIME is now (100 * 10)+(25 * 5)=1125. (Notice the TIME is subtracted from the 25 Dragons most recently added, not the older ones.)
- Note
  - TIME is calculated with a Last-in-First-Out (LIFO) accounting method. This means that the TIME attached to the most recently-added Dragons will be the first to go if any move out of a wallet
