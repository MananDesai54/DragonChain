# Dragonchain
- a hybrid blockchain (public + private blockchain)
- has a 5 level of verification model that increases the security of the blockchain.
- has its own currency called DRGN and also we can make our own currency using dragonchain.
- SDKs are available in many popular languages.
- We can connect with other public blockchains like ETH, BTC and many more.
- We can transact with all those public blockchains and also interact with them. There is the concept of proof of existence. We can interact with public blockchain to estimate details like calculation of hash power. 

# Polygon (an Indian crypto)
- a protocol and a framework for building and connecting Ethereum-compatible blockchain networks.
- Aggregating scalable solutions on Ethereum supporting a multi-chain Ethereum ecosystem.
- SDK is currently available in golang and development is going on in other languages and more modules are growing.
- With the use of polygon chains we can connect ethereum compatible blockchains like plazma, side chains, matic pos chain, matic plasma chain, zk rollups, optimistic rollups. 
- There are two kinds of Polygon chains: Stand alone chains and shared security chains.
- Previously when Polygon was called matic, they created Matic coins so we can consider them as coins for Polygon.
- It has 4 layers of architecture: Ethereum Layer, Security Layer, Polygon Network Later, Execution Layer
- Ethereum and security layers are optional. Architecture is generic and we can choose our suitable architecture and we can change from one to another anytime.
